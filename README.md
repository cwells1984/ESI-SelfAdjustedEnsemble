OVERVIEW

This project was the code for my Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence Course, attempting to improve classifier 
ensemble performance by evolving aggregators instead of using a simple majority vote. Simple self-adaptation was also 
attempted in the evolution of the aggregators.

The PDF of the final report detailing the implementation is included in the project as "FinalReport.pdf".

INSTALLATION

Run the following to install dependencies:
```
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each of the "task_*.py" files has a main method that can be executed. The dataset to be used should be uncommented 
first.
